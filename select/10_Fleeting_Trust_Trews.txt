You make sense of pain through constant motion
Like a soldier on the frontline needs devotion
Peace cry everything is just the ocean
And all ideals like waves are just these notions

Chorus:
'Cause you're wrong and you know right away
And you're wrong and you know you walk in and walk out with no pain and no doubt
--------------------------------------------------------

You took insignificance as omen
Like a faithful at the gates, you're always hoping
Please cry everything is just the ocean
And all ideals like waves are just these notions

Chorus

With fleeting trust in hand, with what I think I am
With fleeting trust I walk in, and walk out with no pain and no doubt

Chorus
